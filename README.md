## 🗒️ Description
Any armor model (except the Turtle Shell and the Elytra) is **invisible** in third person. This comes in handy when no armor model on other players or yourself should be seen. When using it with other players on a server or a realm, keep in mind that all other players are still be able to see the armor models. It is not recommended for competitive games, since there would be a **disadvantage** against other players.

Note: Armor Trims are invisible on Turtle Shells due to their texture being invisible!
